<h1> Who We Are </h1>
DiSCo is a data science community at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev. We are a community with a goal of overall development and growth of students and professional enthusiasts in Beâ€™er-Sheva in areas of data mining, data science, and machine learning. DiSCo meetups act as a platform to provide hands-on experience in data science, tools and techniques, while networking and having fun. We are all about learning, snacks and friendship.

<h1> Our Motivation </h1>
Data science, also known as data-driven science, is an interdisciplinary field of scientific methods, processes and systems to extract knowledge or insights from data in various forms, either structured or unstructured, similar to data mining. Harvard Business Review called it "The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century".

The motivation of this club is to serve as a platform for BGU data science enthusiasts to pursue their interests in data science to learn, network, collaborate, create, and innovate.

<h1> Goals </h1>

* Meet experts from the industry and learn about real-world data science challenges
* Learn and acquire skills using data science tutorials
* Participate in online competitions and practice what we learned
* Form groups and networks for future collaborations
* Have fun! :)
